# Snake Game

A simple classic Snake game built with Python and Tkinter.

## Description

This project implements the classic Snake game with a GUI using Tkinter. The player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Rules

1. Move the snake using the **WASD** keys.
2. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
3. Eat the red food squares to grow longer.
4. Try to grow as large as possible.
5. Press **Escape** to pause or resume the game.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Tkinter comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.

To run the game, simply execute the Python script:

```bash
python snake.py
```
